# Let's Learn Some GitHub!!!!

Using this repository we're going to learn the fundamentals of `git` and GitHub!

We'll start by perusing this website (GitHub), then we'll actually be working using `git` from the command line. We'll cover:

## `git add .` 

This command is the most basic command that will allow you to "add" your changes to the staging area of the version control system

## `git commit -m ""` 

Committing is how we actually ask the version control system to take a look at our changes and "version" those changes for us so we could come back to them later if need be. 

## `git push`

Once we've made and committed our changes, we'll put them up on GitHub for all to see, and make our changes 'pull-able' to others

## `git pull` 

This is the command we'll use to make sure any changes to a repositor are on our local machine before we start working.
